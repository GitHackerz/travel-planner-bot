# HexaBot Custom Plugins: Groq & Serper Integration

A collection of custom plugins developed during the HexaStack Hackathon to enhance HexaBot's capabilities with Groq LLM integration and web search functionality through Serper API.

## üåü Features

### Groq Integration Plugin
- Seamless integration with Groq's API as a fourth LLM option alongside existing Ollama, Gemini, and OpenAI GPT
- Cost-effective alternative to running resource-intensive open-source LLMs locally
- Free API access to open-source LLMs without requiring powerful local hardware
- Flexible model selection from Llama family

### Serper Search Plugin
- Real-time web search capabilities powered by Serper API
- Multiple search types supported:
  - Web search
  - Image search
  - Video search
  - YouTube search
  - Reviews
  - Maps and places
  - Location-based information

## üéØ Use Case: AI Travel Planner

We've demonstrated the power of these plugins through an AI-powered trip planner that:
1. Leverages Groq's LLM capabilities for natural conversation
2. Uses Serper API to fetch real-time information about:
   - Tourist destinations
   - Hotel availability and pricing
   - Seasonal recommendations
   - Local attractions

The chatbot:
- Engages users in conversation about their travel preferences
- Recommends destinations based on season and interests
- Provides curated lists of hotels and attractions
- Offers real-time availability and pricing information

## üöÄ Future Plugin Roadmap

We envision expanding the plugin ecosystem with:
1. Payment gateway integration for direct booking
2. Real-time flight pricing and booking
3. Weather API integration for better travel recommendations
4. Local events and activities aggregator
5. User review integration from multiple platforms
6. Multi-language support for international travelers
7. Travel insurance integration
8. Local transportation options and booking

## üí° Why These Plugins?

Our plugins address key limitations in the current HexaBot ecosystem:
- Enable cost-effective access to powerful LLMs through Groq
- Add real-time data capabilities through Serper
- Create practical applications like the travel planner
- Enhance user experience with comprehensive search capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

- HexaBot compatible environment
- Groq API credentials
- Serper API key
- Node.js runtime environment

## üìù Note

This project was developed during the HexaStack Hackathon to demonstrate the extensibility of the HexaBot platform. The plugins are currently pending activation and integration into the main platform.
